# Book Shop (Django project)

#### I used a free template in this project.
#### In this project, the topic is a bookstore
#### By guiding the Django render partial library and module, I reduced the size of Template base and it became more optimal
#### Using the Django rest framework technology, I built an API for products

pip install python3.9

pip install djangorestframework

```
